Emissions Results
-----------------
- **CO2 trajectory**: How emissions evolve under different scenarios

Cost Results
------------
- **System costs**: Total cost of electricity supply

**Key insights to look for:**
- Initial cost increases from clean technology deployment

Adequacy & Storage
------------------
- **Reliability metrics**: Can the system meet demand reliably?
- **Storage utilization**: How batteries and other storage are used
- **Flexibility requirements**: What provides system flexibility

Reading the Charts
==================

Time Series Plots
------------------
- **X-axis**: Usually years (2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050)
- **Y-axis**: Capacity (GW), Generation (TWh), Emissions (Mt CO2), Costs ($/MWh)
- **Colors**: Different technologies or scenarios
- **Stacked areas**: Show composition and totals simultaneously

**Interpretation tips:**
- Look for inflection points where trends change
- Compare scenario trajectories to understand policy impacts
- Watch for technology transitions (coal→gas→renewables)
- Note the scale - some changes look dramatic but are actually small

Regional Maps
-------------
- **Colors**: Intensity of activity (darker = more capacity/generation)
- **Symbols**: Different technologies or infrastructure
- **Connections**: Transmission lines between regions
- **Overlays**: Renewable resource quality, demand density

**Interpretation tips:**
- Resource-rich regions become generation centers
- High-demand regions import from resource-rich areas
- Transmission expansion connects supply and demand
- Regional specialization emerges over time

Technology Mix Charts
---------------------
- **Pie charts**: Composition at a point in time
- **Stacked bars**: Evolution over time
- **Technology colors**: Consistent across all charts
- **Percentages vs. absolutes**: Different stories

**Interpretation tips:**
- Absolute capacity growth can hide relative share changes
- New technologies often start small but grow exponentially
- Existing technologies may shrink in share but not absolute terms
- Regional mixes can differ dramatically from national averages

Common Patterns to Recognize
============================

The Renewable Transition
-------------------------
**Typical pattern:**
1. **Early phase**: Gas displaces coal for economic reasons
2. **Growth phase**: Solar and wind scale rapidly due to cost declines
3. **Integration phase**: Storage and transmission expand to manage variability
4. **Maturity phase**: System optimizes around renewable-dominant supply

**What to watch for:**
- Renewable capacity grows faster than renewable generation (lower capacity factors)
- Storage deployment accelerates after ~40% renewable penetration
- Transmission expansion connects remote renewables to demand centers
- Remaining fossil plants increasingly provide flexibility, not energy

Regional Specialization
-----------------------
**Typical patterns:**
- **Resource-rich regions**: Become net exporters of renewable electricity
- **Demand-rich regions**: Import clean electricity, focus on storage/flexibility
- **Industrial regions**: May retain some fossil capacity for reliability
- **Remote regions**: May develop local renewable resources

Technology Competition
----------------------
**Common outcomes:**
- **Solar vs. Wind**: Determined by local resource quality and complementarity
- **Battery vs. Pumped Hydro**: Geography and scale determine winner
- **Gas vs. Storage**: Economic trade-off between fuel costs and capital costs
- **Transmission vs. Local Generation**: Distance and resource quality matter

Interpreting Unexpected Results
===============================

When Results Seem Wrong
-----------------------
**Common causes:**
- **Model assumptions**: Check scenario parameters and constraints
- **Data limitations**: Some regions have incomplete or outdated data
- **Optimization artifacts**: Models find unexpected but mathematically optimal solutions
- **Time aggregation**: Annual averages can hide important seasonal dynamics

**Validation approaches:**
- Compare with historical trends and known policies
- Check if results are physically reasonable
- Look at sensitivity to key assumptions
- Examine regional details behind national totals

When Results Seem Too Good/Bad
------------------------------
**Too optimistic:**
- Check if all system costs are included
- Verify that reliability constraints are binding
- Look for unrealistic technology performance assumptions
- Consider implementation barriers not captured in the model

**Too pessimistic:**
- Check if technology cost reductions are included
- Verify that all flexibility options are available
- Look for overly conservative resource assessments
- Consider policy support not captured in scenarios

Using Results for Decision-Making
=================================

For Policy Makers
-----------------
- **Focus on robust trends** across multiple scenarios
- **Identify key decision points** where policy can influence outcomes
- **Understand regional implications** of national policies
- **Consider implementation challenges** not captured in optimization

For Investors
-------------
- **Look for consistent winners** across scenarios
- **Understand timing** of technology deployment
- **Identify regional opportunities** based on resource quality
- **Consider policy risks** that could change outcomes

For Researchers
---------------
- **Validate against other studies** and real-world data
- **Explore sensitivity** to key assumptions
- **Identify knowledge gaps** where better data is needed
- **Develop new scenarios** to test specific hypotheses
