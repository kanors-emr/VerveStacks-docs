**Frequently asked questions about VerveStacks**

General Questions
=================

**What is VerveStacks?**
  VerveStacks is a global library of ready-to-use, fully calibrated national energy system models for more than 100 countries, 
  designed to make advanced energy transition analysis accessible to everyone. Each VerveStacks model incorporates detailed representations
   of the existing energy fleet, large-scale renewables, hydrogen, EV adoption, and sector
    electrification—capturing both hourly and regional variations. Unlike empty model frameworks, VerveStacks provides
     multiple pre-built structural variants per country, available in model-agnostic and Veda-TIMES formats,
      with results for scenarios aligned to climate targets. Researchers, policymakers, and students can immediately explore policy
      -relevant questions and compare modeling structures without investing months in model development.

**Why is the development pipeline closed?**
The proprietary VerveStacks model-generation pipeline is not publicly available to ensure the project’s sustainability and to create a
 new class of model users, rather than just model builders. The pipeline represents years of unfunded, expert development, and 
 releasing it would risk returning modeling practice to its old cycle—where most effort is spent rebuilding models from scratch,
  rather than using and learning from them. By keeping the pipeline closed but releasing curated sets of high-quality model
   variants for open use, VerveStacks shifts focus to wide, impactful usage and transparency while protecting the resources needed
    to grow and maintain the project. This approach aims to establish “model usage” as the new norm for energy
     system analysis—similar to how operating systems made computers widely accessible and useful.

**Which countries are supported?**
  Models can be generated for 190+ countries with sufficient data coverage.

**What data sources are used?**
  IRENA, EMBER, GEM, REZoning, Atlite, AR6 scenarios, and other global energy datasets.

Technical Questions
===================

**What modeling framework is used?**
  Models are generated in VEDA-TIMES format with Excel-based templates.

**How are regions defined?**
  Using Voronoi clustering of population centers, power plants, and renewable zones.

**What time resolution is available?**
  From 1 to 600+ timeslices based on stress-period analysis of hourly data.

**Can I modify the models?**
  Yes, all model files can be downloaded and customized using standard VEDA tools.
