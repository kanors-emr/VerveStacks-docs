# VerveStacks Overview

## What is VerveStacks?

VerveStacks is a revolutionary energy systems modeling platform that automates the creation of country-specific VEDA/TIMES energy models. What traditionally took months of expert work can now be accomplished in minutes, democratizing access to world-class energy system analysis.

## The Evolution Story

### From Artisanal to Automated

VerveStacks represents the culmination of a 30-year journey in energy modeling:

- **1994-2000**: Mathematical foundations with MARKAL and TIMES co-creation
