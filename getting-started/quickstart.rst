============================
Quickstart: Run a Scenario
============================

**From zero to results in 5 minutes**

This guide shows how to pick an ISO model, launch a scenario in Veda Online (VO),
and view the key outputs. No software installation, no configuration, no expertise required.

The 5-Minute Experience
=======================

1. **Browse the model library**: Open the :doc:`/model-library/coverage-map` and select a country
2. **Explore baseline**: Click *Open in Veda Online* to see the current energy system
3. **Choose a climate scenario**: Select from 5 pre-loaded AR6 climate pathways
4. **Run & compare**: Execute the scenario and compare with baseline using the Results viewer
5. **Export insights**: Download charts, data, or complete model files for further analysis

What You'll See
===============

- **Interactive map**: Your country's energy system with demand regions, power plants, and renewable zones
- **Scenario results**: Capacity expansion, generation mix, emissions, and costs through 2050
- **Comparison tools**: Side-by-side analysis of different climate pathways
- **Professional outputs**: Publication-ready charts and comprehensive data exports

No Barriers
===========

- **No software**: Everything runs in your web browser
- **No login**: Explore models immediately without registration
- **No expertise**: Pre-built models ready for immediate policy analysis
- **No waiting**: Cloud infrastructure handles complex optimizations
