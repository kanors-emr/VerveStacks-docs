====================

**Your analytical starting point - from ready-to-use to fully customized**

.. epigraph::

   **Start with validated models, customize with confidence.** VerveStacks eliminates months of setup work, letting you focus on your unique analytical questions.

Three Levels of Customization
=============================

VerveStacks supports a clear spectrum of customization based on your needs, timeline, and expertise:

ðŸŸ¢ Parameter Modifications
---------------------------
**Ready today - Same day to 1 week**

*For immediate insights with existing model structure*

**What You Can Do:**
- Modify technology costs and performance parameters
- Test policy scenarios and carbon pricing impacts
- Adjust renewable deployment targets and timelines
- Change fuel price assumptions and constraints
- Explore different demand growth trajectories

**Who This Serves:** Government analysts, utility planners, researchers conducting sensitivity analysis

**Platform:** VEDA Online or VEDA 2.0 with downloaded models

ðŸŸ¡ Structural Enhancements  
---------------------------
**VEDA-TIMES expertise required - 2-8 weeks**

*For model structure modifications while preserving system integrity*

**What You Can Do:**
- Add new technology representations and sectors
- Enhance transmission topology for congestion analysis
- Implement detailed storage technology modeling
- Develop sector-specific electrification pathways
- Create custom regional demand response programs

**Who This Serves:** Experienced TIMES modelers, research institutions, consulting firms

**Support Options:** DIY with VEDA-TIMES expertise, consultant partnership, or targeted KanORS support

ðŸ”´ Data Pipeline Integration
----------------------------
**KanORS partnership - 1-6 months**

*For maximum analytical precision with proprietary operational data*

**What You Can Do:**
- Replace global datasets with local operational data (10x+ resolution improvement)
- Integrate real-time grid dispatch and constraint data
- Incorporate proprietary demand patterns and industrial processes
- Connect live market pricing and ancillary service costs
- Embed organization-specific technology performance data

**Who This Serves:** Major utilities, government agencies, research institutions with comprehensive datasets
