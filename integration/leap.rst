Using with LEAP
=================

**Integration with LEAP energy planning models**

VerveStacks data can be adapted for LEAP model structures.

LEAP Integration
================

Data Structure
--------------
- Technology tree structure mapping
- Demand sector definitions
- Resource and transformation modules
- Scenario and policy assumptions

Parameter Export
----------------
- Technology cost and performance data
- Demand projections and drivers
- Resource availability and costs
- Environmental coefficients

.. note::
   LEAP export functionality and structure mapping to be implemented.
