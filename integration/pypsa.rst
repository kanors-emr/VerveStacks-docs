**Integration with PyPSA power system models**

VerveStacks spatial and network data can be used with PyPSA modeling.

PyPSA Integration
=================

Network Data
------------
- Transmission network topology
- Generator and load bus assignments
- Line capacity and impedance data
- Regional aggregation mapping

Technology Data
---------------
- Generator technology parameters
- Renewable resource time series
- Storage technology specifications
- Demand profiles and projections

.. note::
   PyPSA export functionality and network mapping to be implemented.
