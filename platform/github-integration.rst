**Open development for transparent energy modeling**

.. epigraph::

   **Open development builds trust.** When energy models influence billion-dollar decisions, the modeling process itself should be as transparent as the results.

Why Open Development
====================

VerveStacks will embrace public development because energy system modeling benefits from:

**Community Validation**
  Global energy experts will be able to review methodological improvements and identify potential issues before they affect models.

**Collaborative Enhancement** 
  Contributions from researchers, practitioners, and institutions worldwide will improve model quality faster than any single team could achieve.

**Academic Rigor**
  Public development will enable peer review, reproducible research, and proper citation of specific model versions.

**User Confidence**
  Transparent development processes will build trust in model results, essential for policy and investment decisions.

How It Works for Users
======================

**Model Downloads**
  Every VerveStacks model will include complete version information, so you will always know exactly what you're using.

**Change Transparency**
  All model improvements will be documented in user-friendly language, explaining what changed and why it matters for your analysis.

**Version Stability**
  Once released, model versions will never be overwrittenâ€”your analysis will remain reproducible indefinitely.

**Community Feedback**
  Users will be able to report issues, suggest improvements, and contribute to model validation through public channels.

Collaboration Features
======================

**Issue Tracking**
  Report model issues, request new features, or suggest methodological improvements through structured feedback channels.

**Documentation Contributions**
  Help improve model documentation, add use case examples, or enhance user guides.

**Validation Studies**
  Share validation results, real-world applications, or comparative analyses to help improve model quality.

**Regional Expertise**
  Contribute local knowledge to improve country-specific model accuracy and relevance.

Quality Assurance
==================

**Systematic Review**
  All changes will undergo review before incorporation into released models, ensuring quality and consistency.

**Validation Testing**
  Model updates will be tested against known benchmarks and validation cases before release.

**Community Oversight**
  Public development will enable community members to identify and address potential issues early.

**Rollback Capability**
  If issues are discovered, previous model versions will remain available while problems are addressed.

What This Means for Your Work
==============================

**Confidence in Results**
  Know that the models you use will have been developed transparently with community oversight and validation.

**Reproducible Analysis**
  Reference specific model versions in your work, with confidence they'll remain available for verification.

**Continuous Improvement**
  Benefit from ongoing model enhancements that will be driven by global community feedback and validation.

**Professional Standards**
  Use models that will be developed according to open science principles, suitable for academic publication and policy analysis.
