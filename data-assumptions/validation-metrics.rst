Validation Metrics
==================

**Quality assurance metrics and benchmarking**

VerveStacks uses multiple validation approaches to ensure model quality.

Validation Approaches
=====================

Historical Calibration
----------------------
- Base year generation matching against EMBER data
- Capacity factor validation for existing plants
- Regional generation pattern consistency
- Technology mix validation against statistics

Cross-Dataset Validation
-------------------------
- Capacity reconciliation between GEM, IRENA, EMBER
- Geographic coordinate validation
- Technology mapping consistency checks
- Missing data identification and documentation

Spatial Validation
------------------
- Clustering algorithm validation
- Geographic boundary consistency
- Transmission connection realism
- Regional aggregation accuracy

Temporal Validation
-------------------
- Timeslice energy conservation
- Stress period identification accuracy
- Hourly profile data completeness
- Seasonal pattern preservation

Quality Metrics
===============

- Data completeness percentages
- Validation error statistics
- Cross-dataset agreement measures
- Geographic accuracy assessments
