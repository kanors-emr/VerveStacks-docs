**Cost and performance assumptions for energy technologies**

VerveStacks uses multiple sources for technology cost and performance parameters.

Cost Data Sources
=================

Existing Plants
---------------
- Vintage-based cost and efficiency assumptions
- Regional cost adjustments
- Technology-specific parameter mapping
- Retirement and retrofit cost assumptions

New Technologies
----------------
- NREL cost and performance databases
- IEA World Energy Outlook assumptions
- Regional cost adjustments and learning curves
- Technology competition parameters

Renewable Technologies
----------------------
- REZoning LCOE data for site-specific costs
- Atlite capacity factors for performance
- Land use and grid connection cost assumptions
- Technology-specific cost curves

Implementation
==============

Cost assumptions are integrated into VEDA templates with appropriate regional and temporal adjustments.

.. note::
   Detailed cost assumption tables and sources to be documented.
