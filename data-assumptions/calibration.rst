Calibration & Checks
======================

**Base year calibration and validation procedures**

VerveStacks models are calibrated to historical data for the base year.

Calibration Process
===================

Generation Calibration
----------------------
- Historical generation data from EMBER
- Technology-specific capacity factor validation
- Regional generation pattern matching
- Seasonal and load profile calibration

Capacity Calibration
--------------------
- Cross-validation between GEM, IRENA, EMBER
- Missing capacity identification and gap-filling
- Technology mapping and aggregation validation
- Retirement and addition tracking

Regional Calibration
--------------------
- Spatial distribution validation
- Transmission flow pattern consistency
- Regional cost and performance adjustments
- Local policy and constraint implementation

Validation Checks
=================

- Energy balance closure
- Capacity utilization reasonableness
- Regional trade pattern validation
- Technology competition consistency

.. note::
   Detailed calibration results and validation statistics to be documented.
