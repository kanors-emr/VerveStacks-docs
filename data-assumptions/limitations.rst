Limitations & Known Gaps
===========================

**Data limitations and model constraints**

VerveStacks models have known limitations that users should understand.

Data Limitations
================

Geographic Coverage
-------------------
- Some countries have incomplete power plant data
- Remote regions may have limited renewable resource data
- Transmission infrastructure data gaps
- Demand pattern estimation limitations

Technology Coverage
-------------------
- Limited representation of emerging technologies
- Simplified storage and flexibility modeling
- Industrial process heat limitations
- Transport sector integration constraints

Temporal Resolution
-------------------
- Timeslice aggregation loses some operational detail
- Seasonal storage representation limitations
- Inter-annual variability not captured
- Long-term planning horizon uncertainties

Model Constraints
=================

Optimization Assumptions
------------------------
- Perfect foresight and rational decision-making
- No implementation barriers or delays
- Simplified policy representation
- Limited behavioral and social factors

Validation Limitations
----------------------
- Historical calibration may not predict future accurately
- Cross-dataset inconsistencies in some regions
- Limited validation against operational data
- Uncertainty quantification challenges

Usage Recommendations
=====================

- Use for directional insights rather than precise predictions
- Compare multiple scenarios to understand sensitivities
- Validate results against local knowledge and data
- Consider limitations when interpreting results

.. note::
   Specific limitations documented for each country model.
