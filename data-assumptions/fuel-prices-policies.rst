Fuel Prices & Key Policies
==========================

**Fuel price trajectories and policy assumptions**

VerveStacks incorporates fuel prices and policy constraints from scenario datasets.

Fuel Price Sources
==================

AR6 Scenarios
-------------
- Global fuel price trajectories by scenario
- Regional price adjustments
- Carbon pricing assumptions
- Policy constraint implementation

Historical Calibration
----------------------
- Base year fuel price calibration
- Regional price differentials
- Transportation and distribution costs
- Tax and subsidy adjustments

Policy Implementation
=====================

Carbon Pricing
--------------
- Scenario-specific carbon price trajectories
- Sectoral coverage and exemptions
- Revenue recycling assumptions

Renewable Policies
------------------
- Renewable portfolio standards
- Feed-in tariff assumptions
- Grid integration requirements
- Technology-specific support mechanisms

.. note::
   Detailed fuel price and policy assumption tables to be provided.
