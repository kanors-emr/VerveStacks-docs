**Data validation and quality control processes**

VerveStacks includes comprehensive quality assurance throughout the model generation process.

Validation Checks
=================

Data Quality
------------
- Coordinate bounds validation by country
- Missing data identification and logging
- Cross-dataset capacity reconciliation
- Technology mapping consistency

Spatial Validation
------------------
- Geographic coordinate validation
- Cluster overlap detection and resolution
- Transmission connection validation
- Regional boundary consistency

Temporal Validation
-------------------
- Timeslice energy conservation checks
- Stress period identification validation
- Hourly profile data completeness

Output Validation
=================

- VEDA template format validation
- Parameter range and consistency checks
- Model file completeness verification
- Documentation generation validation

.. note::
   Detailed validation metrics and error handling procedures to be documented.
