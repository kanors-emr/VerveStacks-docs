**Contributing to and extending VerveStacks**

Opportunities for developers to contribute to the VerveStacks ecosystem.

Contribution Areas
==================

Data Sources
------------
- New dataset integration
- Data quality improvements
- Validation methodology enhancement
- Regional data gap-filling

Methodology
-----------
- Clustering algorithm improvements
- Timeslice design enhancements
- Validation technique development
- Quality assurance procedures

Domain Modules
--------------
- Advanced representations of specific technologies or sectors (e.g., nuclear fuel cycles, hydrogen corridors,
  long-duration storage, industrial process heat, EV charging and V2G)
- Operational detail that can be plugged into existing national baselines without re-building whole models
- Contributions that, once validated, can be promoted into the core VerveStacks data and assumption layers so that
  improvements propagate across all affected country models

Integration
-----------
- New modeling framework exports
- API development and enhancement
- Visualization tool development
- Workflow automation improvements
