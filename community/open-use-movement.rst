===================
Open-Use Movement
===================

**Democratizing energy modeling through accessible tools**

The Open-Use movement shifts focus from building models to using them effectively.

Movement Principles
===================

Accessibility
-------------
- Professional models available without barriers
- Cloud-based analysis eliminates software requirements
- No expertise barriers for basic analysis
- Free access to complete modeling capabilities

Transparency
------------
- Complete data source documentation
- Open methodology and assumption transparency
- Validation and quality metrics available
- Model limitations clearly documented

Usability
---------
- Focus on model application rather than construction
- Professional-quality outputs and analysis tools
- Scenario exploration and comparison capabilities
- Integration with existing modeling workflows

Impact Goals
============

- Enable energy analysis in developing countries
- Support rapid policy development and evaluation
- Facilitate academic research and education
- Accelerate energy transition planning globally

.. note::
   Community participation and contribution opportunities to be documented.
