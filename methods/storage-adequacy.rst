========================
Storage & Adequacy Logic
========================

**Storage representation and adequacy assessment**

VerveStacks includes storage technologies and adequacy metrics in energy system models.

Storage Technologies
====================

Battery Storage
---------------
- Technology parameters from NREL datasets
- Cost and performance assumptions
- Cycling and degradation modeling

Other Storage
-------------
- Pumped hydro from existing plant databases
- Hydrogen storage integration
- Technology competition modeling

Adequacy Assessment
===================

Reliability Metrics
--------------------
- Stress period analysis for system adequacy
- Storage utilization patterns
- Flexibility requirement assessment

Implementation
==============

Storage modeling is integrated into the VEDA template generation with appropriate technology parameters and constraints.

.. note::
   Detailed adequacy metrics and validation methodology to be documented.
