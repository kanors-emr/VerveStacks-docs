Grid Representation
====================

**PyPSA-inspired transmission network modeling with intelligent spatial clustering**

VerveStacks creates realistic transmission network representations by extracting and processing OpenStreetMap (OSM) infrastructure data, applying intelligent clustering algorithms, and integrating renewable energy zones with transmission connectivity. This approach generates PyPSA-compatible network models that balance geographic realism with computational tractability.

Grid Modeling Philosophy
========================

VerveStacks transforms raw transmission infrastructure data into optimized network representations suitable for energy system optimization. Rather than using simplified radial networks or generic templates, the platform processes actual transmission line and substation data to create country-specific grid models that reflect real-world topology and constraints.

**Core Principles:**

- **Geographic Realism**: Networks based on actual transmission infrastructure locations
- **Computational Efficiency**: Intelligent clustering reduces model complexity while preserving essential connectivity
- **Technology Integration**: Seamless connection of renewable energy zones to transmission buses
- **Scalable Complexity**: Adaptive clustering based on country size and infrastructure density

Data Foundation
===============

OSM Infrastructure Data
-----------------------

The grid modeling process begins with comprehensive OpenStreetMap data extraction:

**Transmission Buses (Substations):**
- High-voltage substations and switching stations
- Coordinate validation and country assignment
- Voltage level classification and filtering
- Capacity and operational status where available

**Transmission Lines:**
- High-voltage transmission corridors
- Geographic routing and distance calculation
- Voltage level and capacity specifications
- Cross-border interconnection identification

**Data Quality Assurance:**
- Coordinate bounds validation by country
- Missing data identification and logging
- Cross-dataset capacity reconciliation
- Geographic consistency verification

Multi-Resolution Clustering Framework
=====================================

VerveStacks employs a sophisticated multi-resolution approach to create transmission networks that balance detail with computational efficiency.

Bus Clustering Methodology
---------------------------

**DBSCAN Spatial Clustering:**
- **Algorithm**: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
- **Purpose**: Reduce bus count while preserving network topology
- **Parameters**: Configurable clustering distance (typically 10-50 km)
- **Advantage**: Handles irregular geographic distributions and identifies isolated nodes

**Clustering Process:**
1. **Coordinate Projection**: Transform to appropriate distance-based coordinate system (EPSG:3035)
2. **Density Analysis**: Identify bus clusters based on spatial proximity
3. **Centroid Calculation**: Compute representative locations for each cluster
4. **Capacity Aggregation**: Sum transmission capacities within clusters
5. **Connectivity Preservation**: Maintain essential network topology

Load Distribution Algorithms
-----------------------------

VerveStacks implements two complementary approaches for distributing electricity demand across transmission buses:

**Voronoi Tessellation Method:**
- **Principle**: Each bus serves the geographically closest demand centers
- **Implementation**: Voronoi cells define exclusive service territories
- **Population Weighting**: Cities influence load distribution based on population
- **Threshold**: Minimum population of 1,000,000 for major demand centers
- **Advantage**: Guarantees non-overlapping service areas

**Distance-Weighted Assignment:**
- **Principle**: Cities influence multiple buses based on inverse distance weighting
- **Decay Function**: Influence decreases with distance² (configurable exponent)
- **Maximum Range**: 100 km influence radius (configurable)
- **Population Threshold**: Minimum 10,000 population for demand centers
- **Advantage**: More realistic load sharing across nearby transmission nodes

Network Visualization Examples
-------------------------------

VerveStacks generates comprehensive network visualizations that demonstrate the voltage filtering and clustering methodology. These examples show how different grid definitions create models optimized for multi-period optimization with fine timeslices.

**Germany: Voltage Filtering Comparison**

The comparison between EUR and KAN grid definitions for Germany illustrates the voltage filtering approach:

.. figure:: /_static/images/grid/DEU_network_visualization_eur.svg
   :alt: Germany Network - EUR Grid (High Detail)
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Germany Transmission Network - EUR Grid Definition (795 buses, 1,029 lines)

   :alt: Germany Network - KAN Grid (Filtered)
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

   Germany Transmission Network - KAN Grid Definition (481 buses, 671 lines)

The EUR grid captures detailed high-voltage infrastructure, while the KAN grid applies voltage filtering to create a coarser network suitable for responsive multi-period optimization. This filtering achieves a **39% reduction in buses** (795→481) and **35% reduction in lines** (1,029→671), significantly reducing model complexity while preserving essential transmission corridors and connectivity patterns.

These visualizations demonstrate how VerveStacks adapts the grid modeling approach to different geographic and infrastructure contexts:

**Voltage Filtering Methodology:**

The transition from detailed (EUR) to optimized (KAN) grid representations involves:

This approach enables VerveStacks models to achieve computational efficiency necessary for fine timeslice resolution (up to 8760 hours) and multi-period investment optimization while maintaining geographic realism in transmission constraints.
