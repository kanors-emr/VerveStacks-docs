Retrofit & CCS Paths
=====================

**Carbon capture and storage retrofit options**

VerveStacks includes CCS retrofit possibilities for existing thermal plants.

CCS Retrofit Modeling
======================

Technology Options
------------------
- Post-combustion capture for existing plants
- Retrofit cost and performance penalties
- CO2 transport and storage costs

Cost Methodology
-----------------
- Based on EPA cost estimation methods
- Capacity and efficiency penalties included
- Flat CO2 transport/storage cost assumptions

Implementation
==============

CCS retrofits are modeled as technology options in VEDA templates with appropriate cost and performance parameters.

.. note::
   Detailed retrofit cost methodology and assumptions to be documented.
